# UdacityDataScienceProject1

This repo is used for developing data/visualizations for use in the first project of Udacity's Advanced Data Science nanodegree program, which the author is working on. Some of the output is included in the author's related blobpost on Medium (insert link when complete).

The notebook code requires the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scitkit-learn
- statsmodels
- plotly
- seaborn
- kaleidoscope (for saving the choropleth image as a file)
- dataframe-image (for saving formatted Pandas dataframes as images)
